# Employee_Churn_Prediction

This work has been done to calculate the probability of employee churn in an organisation. Several classification algorithm were used for grid search and the best model (XGBClassifier) has been used in this work. The model was able to achieve an accuracy of 98.2% with a precision of 97.2% and a recall of 95.3%.

The code here is based on the tutorial from https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/predicting-employee-churn-python
